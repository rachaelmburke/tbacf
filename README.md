The goal of tbacf is to be a repo for data / code (markdown files) and also a website to share our code and data in a transparent and open way.

The website is at https://rachaelmburke.github.io/tbacf/

This repo contains the following documents and folders.  

  * "docs" : this is where the pages on the website live.  There are four markdown files here (a_setup.rmd, b_tableandfig.rmd, c_analysis.rmd and d_tableandfig.rmd) that contain all code to do our analyses from the paper.  The "index.rmd" document (which is the front page of the website) explains content.
  
  * "data_sharing": this contains a .rds file of "extra_info" with a few extra columns about microbiological status of people diagnosed with TB.  Note that the vast majority of data in this analysis is in the "mlwdata" package, which is over at https://github.com/petermacp/mlwdata . At the moment the shape files of TAs to recreate map are not in here, but once we get confirmation we can upload to a public repo they will be added here.
  
  * "files":  this contains a few extra files that might be useful for understanding our project.
  
  * "figures": this is where figures for paper are saved.
